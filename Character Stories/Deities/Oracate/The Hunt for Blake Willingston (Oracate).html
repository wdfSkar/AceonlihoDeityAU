	<h2>Chapter I</h2><br>
		<p>
			Approximately three weeks have passed since the Artifact has been recovered and stored securely a place no mortal can access. <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> went back to the bunker on Trigon, to see if there was anything he missed in his rush to find Yaku. Toxic gas has filled the place, being sustained in the sealed bunker. <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> chuckled to himself, a useless defense against gods as they don't breathe. After a thorough search, finding a map of outposts, most of which he already knew about, but one spot stood out in particular, a bunker below where he initially found Blake Willingston, it was noted that it was lined with Magnesium on the outside preventing <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> from sensing it, he noted down where the entrance to the bunker was located in the warehouse. He portalled back to his temple, then flew to the warehouse, swiftly making his way to the entrance of the bunker. It appeared to be an office, nothing out of place, and nothing that would make someone think it was hiding anything. <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> lined his hand against the wall, directly adjacent to the desk is a hidden switch, when pushed, opens a hatch on the other side of the desk, and what appeared to be an elevator rose from the misplaced carpet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Stepping onto the elevator, <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> presses the button to go down, joking to himself how the Order of the Elders must love bunkers. As he descends he creates his invisibility illusion upon himself should anyone remain down there.
		</p>
		<p>
			Reaching the bottom, no one is to be seen, as he expected. Continuing his path, a small armoury on his left after passing through a doorway, still no sign of inhabitance. He continues to walk around before stopping at a door labelled 'Blake Willingston's Office.'. Attempting to open the door he discovered that it is locked, hearing a voice on the other side.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Who's there?" A voiced called out from the other side having noticed <span style="color:#323334">Oracate's</span> attempt to open the door.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Open the door,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> responded, "<span style="color:#323334">I'd rather not break down the door if possible.</span>"<br>
			"Tell me who you are first." The voice called back.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">The arbitor of your life.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> yelled, annoyed.<br>
			"You come in here, you're dead!"<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> pushes against the door, breaking it off its hinges falling on the floor immediately. The voice readies his rifle.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Leave."
			"<span style="color:#323334">Don't waste your munitions, mortal weapons can't harm me,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> continued, unphased by the gun, "<span style="color:#323334">However, you tell me what you know about a man named Blake Willingston, and I'll let you live.</span>"<br>
			"I'd rather die."<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">That can be arranged, you see, you do not have the luxury of being able to come back from death.</span>"<br>
			The guard remained silent.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">You have a choice, you can either tell me while you're alive, and still be able to roam this planet, or you can tell me in death,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> continued, "<span style="color:#323334">the method doesn't matter to me, only the result.</span>"<br>
			The guard shoots <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span>, the deity remaining unharmed.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">What part of mortal weaponry can't harm me did you not understand?</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> commented, confused with mortal behaviour.<br>
			The guard, dropping his weapon, begged "Please don't hurt me."<br>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> rolled his eyes, "<span style="color:#323334">I'm not going to hurt you, just tell me what you know.</span>"<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			The guard had told <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> everything he knew about Blake Willingston, going on for about two hours. <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> had let the guard go, as he said he would, but slipped him the rune he held on his belt should he need to track him down again. Inconvenient as he used that rune to access his portal network on the go, and making another rune would be very exhausting, but nevertheless worth it, <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> made note to carry a spare rune should he need to keep track of someone again. He flew back to his temple to write down everything the guard told him, putting it in his map room, now used to track down the errant soul.
		</p>
		<p>
			He visited his vault to see if he had any extra runes stored so he wouldn't have to create another. Fortunately he had four extra, he previously had five, but he gave one to <a href="C:\Users\skar5\OneDrive\Desktop\Aceonliho Lore\Aceonliho Deity Site\Deities\Mac.html" style="color:#CEFFCA">Wyrid</a>. He grabbed two, one to replace the he had on his belt, and the other so he could keep track of another person if he needs to.
		</p>
		<p>
			He decided to see if he could locate <a href="C:\Users\skar5\OneDrive\Desktop\Aceonliho Lore\Aceonliho Deity Site\Mortals\The Watcher.html" style="font-family: Sofia">The Watcher</a>. He thought that the possibility of them knowing anything about Blake Willingston was good enough to be worth the effort to track down the mysterious figure.
