	<h2>Chapter I</h2><br>
		<p>
			Eons, eons has he lived, wandering the realm, causing mischief wherever he roamed, though there wasn't many inhabitants of this realm; him, and 4 others. He never really stayed in one place for long, however he did spend a lot more time in his temple upon the top of the hardest mountain to climb in the mountain range, or the giant tree in the center of the lake with the Creator.
		</p>
		<p>
			After the battle with the Primordial, he was sent into a coma for eons, and awoke in a new world with new deities.
		</p>
		<p>
			He wandered around the giant tree in the range to visit some old friends, having met <a href="C:\Users\skar5\OneDrive\Desktop\Aceonliho Lore\Aceonliho Deity Site\Deities\Aki.html" style="color:#77309F">Terra</a> and <a href="C:\Users\skar5\OneDrive\Desktop\Aceonliho Lore\Aceonliho Deity Site\Deities\Error.html" style="color:#c40000">Clocks</a> when he woke, he first set a path to locate <a href="C:\Users\skar5\OneDrive\Desktop\Aceonliho Lore\Aceonliho Deity Site\Deities\Ren.html" style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</a>, and then <a href="C:\Users\skar5\OneDrive\Desktop\Aceonliho Lore\Aceonliho Deity Site\Deities\Mew.html" style="color:#F30066">Ava</a>. On his journey he met new deities, deities of all kinds of things, one had sky, another had eggs, and one was so egotistical that it could be assumed he reigned over the ego domain. These were the deities he encountered on his path towards who they called "The <a href="C:\Users\skar5\OneDrive\Desktop\Aceonliho Lore\Aceonliho Deity Site\Deities\Skar.html" style="color:#323334">Ve</a><a href="C:\Users\skar5\OneDrive\Desktop\Aceonliho Lore\Aceonliho Deity Site\Deities\Aki.html" style="color:#77309F">ne</a><a href="C:\Users\skar5\OneDrive\Desktop\Aceonliho Lore\Aceonliho Deity Site\Deities\Ren.html" style="color:#b256e7">ra</a><a href="C:\Users\skar5\OneDrive\Desktop\Aceonliho Lore\Aceonliho Deity Site\Deities\Mew.html" style="color:#F30066">bl</a><a href="C:\Users\skar5\OneDrive\Desktop\Aceonliho Lore\Aceonliho Deity Site\Deities\Error.html" style="color:#c40000">es</a>", his friends who aided in the battle against the Primordial.
		</p><br>
		<p>
			After reuniting with the other <span style="color:#323334">Ve</span><span style="color:#77309F">ne</span><span style="color:#b256e7">ra</span><span style="color:#F30066">bl</span><span style="color:#c40000">es</span>, he made his way to his temple, making his way up the mountain with ease as he has done this trip a million times before. After reaching the entrance to his temple, he saw it had fallen into disrepair; pillars a strew, doors crumbled.
		</p>
		<p>
			He had encountered a girl before the temple entrance, arguing with someone in a raised outcrop on the wall.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I just want to see the temple, can I please enter?" the girl inquired, exasperated.<br>
			"No. I already told you, visitors are not tolerated within these walls" the figure on the outcrop responded.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			The <span style="color:#323334">deity</span> stepped in, "<span style="color:#323334">May I inquire as to when that rule came into place, and as to who you might be?</span>", he asked the figure in the outcrop.
		</p>
		<p>
			<p>
			"I am the inhabitant of this temple, and you will bow to me, the god of chaos." the figure responded to the deity.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">How bold of you.</span>" the <span style="color:#323334">deity</span> responded.<br>
			"Bold? How so?" the figure retorted back.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">That you lie in such a manner, this temple does not belong to you,</span>" the <span style="color:#323334">deity</span> continued, "<span style="color:#323334">and to claim to be a deity when you are not one is rather frowned upon.</span>"<br>
			"I am a deity!" the figured stated, with a slight bit of anger in his voice.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">No you are not, or if you are, you are not the god of chaos.</span>" the<span style="color:#323334">deity</span> responded, with only calmness.<br>
			"And who are you exactly? To make such a claim." the figure responded angrily, not hiding it anymore.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">I am the actual god of chaos, my name is <a href="C:\Users\skar5\OneDrive\Desktop\Aceonliho Lore\Aceonliho Deity Site\Deities\Skar.html" style="color:#323334">Oracate</a>, and this is my temple,</span>" the <span style="color:#323334">deity</span> responded, with inhuman calmness, "<span style="color:#323334">and while visitors are more than welcome in these walls, you are not, not anymore, leave these grounds willingly, or I will remove you by force.</span>"<br>
			"No. This is MY temple." the figure responded, even angrier.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Very well, you cannot say I did not warn you,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> responded, while send earth pillars forcing the figure onto the ground. "<span style="color:#323334">Now leave.</span>"<br>
			</p>
		</p><br>
		<p>
			The figure, filled with rage, lunged at <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span>, doing everything in his power to try and hurt him. <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> grabs the figure and lifts him into the air with ease.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334">You mortals are weightless, aren't you? I was more than happy to let you leave, but since you have forced my hand, I'm afraid that that is no longer and option. Do enjoy your trip.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> said, with the slightest bit of annoyance, sending him flying off the mountain.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334">As for you, las, as I said prior, visitors are welcome within these walls, I'm rather afraid that visiting the temple will not happen today for you, as I need to repair it, but should you come another time, I'd be more than willing to give you a tour. However, at this moment, the temple is unavailable for visiting by mortals, may you have a good day.</span>"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Thank you, I will visit again, hopefully I will be able to see the temple then." the girl responded, leaving down the mountain.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334">I do look forward to seeing you then.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> yelled, just before she left hearing range.

		<p>
			After re-exploring the temple to find where repair is needed, he notices the vault is open. How? He installed it in such a way that only <i>he</i> could open it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Entering the vault, he looks around to see what all it missing, everything that could be conceived to be valuable remained, in fact, only one thing was missing, and <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> became intent on getting <i>it</i> back.
		</p>
		<p>
			With anger in his eyes, he tracks down the mortal he threw off the mountain. He searched the area thoroughly to find him, and he came across the mortal, severely injured from the flight.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334">YOU.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> yelled out.<br>
			The mortal's face turned to terror, "Wh- What d-do you want?" the mortal spewed, voice raspy.<br><br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">The Vault. How did you open it?</span>" the <span style="color:#323334">deity</span> spoke, picking up the mortal, "<span style="color:#323334">Tell me.</span>"<br>
			"I didn't open it." the mortal, spoke, with pain in his voice.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Then. Who. Did?</span>" the <span style="color:#323334">deity</span> responded, with anger showing.<br>
			"The guy who was there before me. I don't know his name" the mortal replied, pleading.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Where is he?</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> shouted.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			The mortal fell limp, his last bit of life had left. <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> tossed the now-dead mortal to the ground.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Bloody mortals. Their body so fragile and weak. Useless.</span>" the <span style="color:#323334">deity</span> scoffed, inconvenienced.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			He flew around the mortal world, gathering clues on a possible location.
		</p>
		<p>
			After finding enough of them to locate the old inhabitant of his temple, he flew to the entrance of the building. He saw the building was sealed off with what appeared to be 10 feet of reinforced steel. <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> was unsure if they were trying to keep something in, or someone out. After further examining, he found that the only way he can enter is through force. He went to the wall of what he thought to be the entrance, put his hand on the wall, and pushed his hand forward an inch with significant speed. This threw the wall barreling to the back of the room 20 feet away.
		</p><br>
		<p>
			He encountered 5 men, armed with heavy weaponry, who pointed their guns at him.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">I'll make you a deal, you drop your weapons, and I'll let you walk away unscathed.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> responded calmly.<br>
			"Leave." a guard said, unaverred.<br>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> sighed, "<span style="color:#323334">I'm rather afraid that will not be happening, so consider this your final chance. Drop your weapons.</span>"<br>
			The guards opened fire on the <span style="color:#323334">deity</span>, causing <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> to unfurl his wings and use them as a shield. After about 20 seconds, the gunfire stopped.<br>
			Furling his wings, <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> cleared the smoke and spoke, "<span style="color:#323334">Unfortunately for you lot, due to you opening fire, the deal's off.</span>"<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			A fight erupts between the 5 mortals, and the <span style="color:#323334">deity</span>. Several shots were fired, and the sounds of bones cracking and breaking were heard all throughout it.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <span style="color:#323334">deity</span>, victorious, continued on the warehouse, and came across a man, with the appearance of utter anger sewn across his face.<br>
			"You will regret that." the man lunged at the <span style="color:#323334">deity</span> with inhuman speeds, faster than any speed the <span style="color:#323334">deity</span> has seen a mortal has been before.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			In one swift action the <span style="color:#323334">deity</span> caught the punch the man attempted to throw, forcing him to stop in place. <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> then flicked his wrist to swing the man's arm to the side, spinning him off balance and causing him to fall. Sirens are heard in the distance.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Do tell, how will <i>I</i> regret that?</span>" the <span style="color:#323334">deity</span> responded, rather amused.<br>
			"I will kill you." the man yelled, ignoring the question, trying to get up.<br>
			The <span style="color:#323334">deity</span> simply picked him up and threw him to the wall behind. Footsteps being heard rushing to their location.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Is that so?</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> replied, scoffing, "<span style="color:#323334">I'm afraid you're incorrect.</span>" he continued.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Whether you are feigning ignorance, or are simply unable to comprehend the circumstance you find yourself in,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> continued, now his voice threatening, "<span style="color:#323334">What you fail to understand, is that I, and I alone, am the arbiter of your life.</span>"<br>
		</p><br>
		<p>
			Guns are heard being drawn behind the <span style="color:#323334">deity</span>.<br>
			"POLICE. FREEZE!" the cops yell from behind.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">I'm rather afraid you're outside your jurisdiction, this is no longer a mortal affair. Leave now.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> responed, "<span style="color:#323334">As I was saying, you have the ability to walk away unscathed, or you can not walk away at all. It all depends on how much you attempt to lie to me.</span>"<br>
			"GET DOWN ON THE GROUND. OR WE WILL OPEN FIRE." the police yell.<br>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> lets out a deep sigh, "<span style="color:#323334">Don't waste your munitions, I'm immortal.</span>"<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			A shot is fired at <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span>, failing to injure the <span style="color:#323334">deity</span> due to his regeneration.
		</p>
		<p>
			Annoyed. <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> states, "<span style="color:#323334">It seems we will have to continue this elsewhere.</span>". As the <span style="color:#323334">deity</span> snaps his fingers, a portal to <i>The Container</i> is opened and <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> tosses the man into it.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">As for you, I'm afraid this is where we part, I do hope our next encounter won't have your weapons drawn, I'd rather not have to meddle with your mortal affairs. May you have a rather good day.</span>" the <span style="color:#323334">deity</span> says, before leaving through the portal as well, closing the portal behind him.<br>
		</p><br><br>
		<p>
			Oracate spends the next seven minutes attempting to get the mortal to reveal the location, failing to do so.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I'll die before I tell you where it is!" The man stated.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Oh that can be arranged, I personally don't care whether you're alive or not, and I'm sure I can ask <span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span> to hold off on collecting your soul for a little bit</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> replied, without care.<br>
			"You think I'm scared of empty threats like that?" He retorted.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">You have seen me remain unfazed from bullets, lift and throw you, a 500 pound man, as though you were a feather, and you think <i>that</i> is an empty threat? You really are as dumb as you look.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> responded to the nonsensical statement the man had said.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Hours later, having still not gotten the location; <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> had decided to leave the man in the Container, and returned to the mortal world; a place called "Earth".<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Mortals.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> scoffs.<br>

		<p>
			After exploring a bit more of Earth, he travels to all sorts of places, learning things about Earth, and how humans operate, though this is to further his interrogation with that mortal, as well as try to find the object in the meantime while waiting for the mortal to reveal the location.
		</p><br>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> was walking about, later stumbling across a mortal trying to stab another.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Oh no you don't.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> stated, grabbing the mortal with the knife and pulling him back.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">You again?</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> said to the other mortal, the girl he encountered at his temple.<br>
			"Hi." The mortal said, meekly.<br>
			"I'm going to stab you too!" The mortal hanging from <span style="color:#323334">Oracate's</span> grasp said, seething with anger"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Good luck with that. You, girl, what's your name?</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> responded without a hint of concern.<br>
			"<a href="C:\Users\skar5\OneDrive\Desktop\Aceonliho Lore\Aceonliho Deity Site\Mortals\Sara McCallister.html">Sara</a>." the girl responded.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			The hanging mortal try to slash <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span>, failing to injure the god.<br>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> lets out a sigh, "<span style="color:#323334">Did you not here me?</span>"<br>
			"Maybe take him to the police too?" Sara suggested.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">And where would that be?</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> responded.<br>
			"Follow me." Sara said.<br>
		</p><br>
		<p>
			After following Sara for about ten minutes, <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> arrives at the police station with the guy in hand.<br>
			Immediately after entering the police station 1 cop pulls his gun out and aims at <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span>.<br>
			"Drop him and step away NOW!" the cop demanded, "You're not getting away this time."<br>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> did as asked and dropped the mortal and stepped away.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Can I ask as to what you mean with the latter half of that?</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> inquired.<br>
			"You sent that guy through what looked like a portal." the cop replied.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">You were there? Very well, contrary to our last interaction, I am not someone who is of any harm, and I can explain the context for that. Though I'm not quite sure you'd believe me</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> responded.<br>
			"Try me." The cop replied, smugly.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Would you believe me if I told you that the individual was either in possession of, or knew where a relic is, that very relic being a part of a being who nearly wiped this entire universe we roam this very moment?</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> replied.<br>
			The cop shook his head.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Didn't think so, so if you don't mind, I will be going, he's been in there for about 12 hours now, so I do have to get back to him, may you have a good day.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> stated before leaving.<br>
			"Where do you think you're going?" The cop yelled out.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">The Container.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> stated, just before leaving through a portal and closing it behind him.<br>

		<p>
			"I'm not telling you anything." The man yelled, noticing <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span>.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">How is it you still fail to see your circumstance?</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> responded, "<span style="color:#323334">You really believe you'll leave here before you tell me anything?</span>" he continued.<br>
			"I know I will. It's only a matter of time before they come and rescue me." The man responded, with smugness emanating.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">I'm rather afraid, that unfortunately for you, that will not be happening,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> retorted, continuing, "this is a place where the only person who can access, is me."<br>
			"You fail to realize," He replied, "They have the artifact. They can do <b>anything</b>."<br>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> chuckles.<br>
			"What's so funny?" The man queried.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">You just said you didn't have it, you voluntarily—</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> said, chuckling.<br>
		</p>
		<p style="font-size:25px">
			BOOM
		</p>
		<p>
			An explosion roared, cutting off <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Told you." The man stated with utter smugness.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Shoot the one standing." A strange distorted voice yelled, followed by charge-up for a weapon.<br>
			A shot gets fired, hitting <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span>.<br>
			"Grab the one tied up." The voice stated.<br>
			In the smoke from the shot, the sounds of men picking up someone and running off is heard.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Why is it that mortals don't seem to realize that I can't be harmed by them.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> questioned, shrugging off the energy shot.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">And where do you think you're going?</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> asked rhetorically, sending a rock wall to stop them.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Portalling to behind the wall he created by making a portal below him, <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> remained behind the wall waiting for them to blow it down. After blowing up the wall they see <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> standing behind the wall.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Shoot him again!" the voice yelled.<br>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> dodges the shot, "<span style="color:#323334">Not this time.</span>" and begins to walk towards them.<br>
			"Shoot again!" the voice yells in frustration.<br>
			The shot hits <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span>, doing little to harm the deity.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Did you not learn from the first time?</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> asked.<br>
			"Hit him with the artifact." The voice yells, desperate.<br>
		</p>
		<p style="font-size:25px">
			BOOM
		</p>
		<p>
			An explosion is heard echoed, the blast hitting and stunning <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span>, allowing the voice and their crew to get away with the man.

			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span>, lying in <i>The Container</i>, having just woken up from an unknown period of unconsciousness.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Aaargh, what the bloody hell was that</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> asked, inquisitively.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many questions soared through <span style="color:#323334">Oracate's</span> mind; what did they hit him with?, how long was he out?, and most importantly, who were <i>they</i>?
		</p>
		<p>
			As soon as <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> was able to stand and stay standing, he made a portal to his Rune in <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku's</span> temple, trying to find her.

		<p>
			After locating <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span>, <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> began to recap what had just occurred, asking for <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku's</span> help.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334"><span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span>, I need your help</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> said, panting from having just awoke.<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Yes of course, what is it?</span>" <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> responded.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">The Relic. It's gone and someone has it.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> replied, with urgency in his voice, "<span style="color:#323334">And their using it. They used it on me.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Are you okay?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">I'm fine, now.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Do you have any leads? What they look like? Where they went?</span>" <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> queried.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">No, they hit me with it. It was the power of chaos, sent me flying and knocked me unconscious. They broke into the Container. They used the Relic to get in,</span>" Oracate continued, "<span style="color:#323334">And they took my only lead.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">How did they even get in?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">I don't know. The guy I had didn't reveal anything.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">He must know something, or at least know someone who does.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">That's why I put him in the Container.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">I think we should get <span style="color:#77309F">Aesterulaknii</span>.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Question, have you gone to collect the souls from a metal warehouse on Earth yet?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Yeah I noticed something was off on the soul counting</span>" <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> said, checking her monitor, "<span style="color:#b256e7">I was going to check it out, my dear <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span>, I just started my shift, what's it that you've done?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Egh, it'll be easier to show you, shall we?</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> responded.<br>
			With Confusion, <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> replied, "<span style="color:#b256e7">Fine, lead the way.</span>"<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> and <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> fly off to the warehouse.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Now, before we go in, I want to clarify that I gave them an opportunity to avoid this.</span>"
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> and <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> enter the warehouse, <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> summoning her spear goes in before <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span>.
		</p><br>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Before you go and collect their souls, I need information,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> shouted, "<span style="color:#323334">particularly about the man they were guarding.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Fine, but you better be ready they don't tend to stick for long after being appeased, however I can hold one or two souls to the human realm until you're done with the questioning,</span>" <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> continued, "<span style="color:#b256e7">Just tell me who it is you need to stick around.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">To the human realm? what about in another realm? Can they be held indefinitely?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Are you alluding to the fact that you want to carry a human soul to The Container?</span>" <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> inquired, "<span style="color:#b256e7">If so,</span>" she said, doubtedly, "<span style="color:#b256e7">I believe it is possible, but as of right now, appeasing the souls is my main priority, tell me the one you need so that I can bind him, and only him so that you later take his soul into The Container. You know I don't like keeping souls stuck in here so you better be quick about it, okay?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Slight problem with that, I don't know which one has the info we need,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> continued, "<span style="color:#323334">would it be possible to bind them to be transported to the Container so that they can be questioned there?</span>"<br>
			Annoyed, <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> responds, "<span style="color:#b256e7">It can be done, but it will take time for me to appease each soul, I need to go one by one and binding and doing so in a plain like Container takes a lot of energy, I'll need your help,</span>" she continued, "<span style="color:#b256e7">You'll need to act fast and Open a portal as soon as you see one of the souls is appeased, that way I'll be able to bind them.</span>"	
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> opens a portal to the Container, aiding <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> in transporting the bound souls.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> hands <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> a Jark'ay Arariwa talisman, so that he may be able to interact, and further question the souls that the duo brought into <i>The Container</i>, with <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> following him.
		</p><br>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> had then spent the next eighty-four Earth hours in <i>The Container</i> questioning them, only learning two things: the Man's name is <i>Blake Willingston</i>, and that the man is apart of something called the <i>Order of the Elders</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> grew rather annoyed, and let <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> collect the souls he had borrowed.

	<h2>Chapter VI</h2><br>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> had grown rather fustrated. The Artifact being outside his possession, let alone in a <i>mortal's</i> possession is a dangerous occurrence. A question occurred to him, how did no other deity notice? The young ones, he could understand, but <span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span>? <span style="color:#F30066">Ava</span>, <span style="color:#c40000">Clocks</span>? Even <span style="color:#77309F">Terra</span>? How did no other <span style="color:#323334">Ve</span><span style="color:#77309F">ne</span><span style="color:#b256e7">ra</span><span style="color:#F30066">bl</span><span style="color:#c40000">e</span> notice?
		</p>
		<p>
			The Artifact contains part of <i>him</i>, and that is something that <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> could not allow to be in the hands of mortals. And one thing was certain, he needed to find a way to locate Blake Willingston, and his little Order of the Elders, before they caused anymore damage with the Artifact. The problem being, he didn't know how.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> almost has any way of finding out now that Nunayaku took the souls. Almost.
		</p>
		<p>
			The one clue that he had was that this order, they had a way to access pocket dimensions, and that is something the Artifact could not do.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> flew back to the warehouse, to see if there were any clues he could find before leaving. After all, why would they have ten feet of reinforced steel covering all exterior surfaces if they didn't need it. <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> went back to the room he originally met Blake Willingston, only to see two teenagers in the room. <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> had ducked behind something, and listened to what they were saying, in case they knew something that could help him.
		</p><br>
		<p>
			"I'm telling you, something isn't right here, the missing wall where we came in didn't just magically end up on the other side of the room." the first teen exclaimed.<br>
			"Yea yea, I get it, you're paranoid." the other teen responded, with an annoyance that lacked subtlety.<br>
			"And what is your explanation to the ten foot thick steel wall being on the other side of the room?" the first teen responded back with the same tone of annoyance as the other.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">These two nitwits aren't helpful.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> mumbled to himself.<br>
			"What was that?" the first teen exclaimed, with terror in his voice.<br>
			"You're such a scaredy-cat Jake, you know that?" the second teen responded, mockingly as he walked up to where Oracate hid.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> transformed into a black cat, just before the teen walked to where he was.
		</p>
		<p>
			"See, it was just a kitty cat, maybe you two can bond about how you two are cats." the teen said, continuing his mocking.<br>
			"Max, you're not listening, we need to go, this is a sign." Jake said, still scared.<br>
			"You're just paranoid," Max had stated, picking up <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span>, and then continuing, "see, this cat is harmless."<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Put me down.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> hissed.<br>
			"Did that cat just talk?" Max questioned, dropping <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> and leaping back.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Yes, I did,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> answered, transforming back, "<span style="color:#323334">and you really should listen to your friend, he has some sense.</span>" the <span style="color:#323334">deity</span> continued, looking at Max as he finsished the sentence.<br>
			"Who ar— What are you?" Jake said, now terrified.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Rolling his eyes, <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> simply walked past them, to continue his investigation, while trying his best to ignore them.
		</p><br>
		<p>
			"HELLO?" Max yelled, trying to get the deity's attention.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">ugh, what?</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> snapped back.<br>
			"What are you? Who are you?" Max responded back.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Is that really what you bothered me with? These simple questions?</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> replied back.<br>
			"I want answers!" Max shouted back at the deity.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">You mortals and your silly little questions, you humans are the inquisitive type aren't you? Very well, you have three questions each, think carefully about how you want to use them.</span>" the <span style="color:#323334">deity</span> responded.<br>
			"What do you mean by mortals?" Jake asked, still scared.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Should've expected that; I am a deity, and my name is <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span>, whereas you and your friend are mortals.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> answered.<br>
			"Actual answers please." Max stated.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Just because one of my domains is deception that does not mean that every word I state is a lie, and not to discount the fact that I just shapeshifted in front of you.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> replied.<br>
			"You're the god of Chaos, my great grandpa talked about you." Jake stated.<br>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> turned his head back to Jake, "<span style="color:#323334">Yes, and how did your great grandfather know of me? I only awoke about ten days ago.</span>"<br>
			"Domains? Awoken? God of Chaos?" Max had asked his questions in bombardment.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">One: all deities carry domians, some are based off objects, some creatures, some concepts, sometimes a deity can bestow some of their domain onto another deity, these deities have less power in this domain, then there are domains to which two deities can have equal power over. Two: Long story short I awoke from an eons long coma after a battle with a great and powerful being, not one you need to be concerned with. Three: Chaos is my primary domain, and just one in my arsenal, deception is another. You're out of questions.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> answered each.<br>
			"Why give this information? And why tell <i>us</i>?" Jake asked.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">I said I'd asnwer three questions from each of you, and I tell you because no one will believe you anyways, mortals are funny like that. And you're out of questions, now leave.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> answered the final questions.<br>
		</p><br>
		<p>
			Continuing his investigation he found a encoded map, a map that he theorized would at least tell him how to find this order. <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> continued his search, finding nothing else in the room. <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> grabbed a little stone that held a rune from his belt, a rune that led to his portal network, and used it to go back to his temple, so he could try to decode the map.

	<h2>Chapter VII</h2><br>
		<p style="font-size:25px">
			FOUR MONTHS LATER
		</p>
		<p>
			Even after four months, he still can't figure out where this map leads, he must've scoured the Earth a hundred times over in search of where this place could be, lacking any idea on how to decode the map. The risk of mortals continuing to hold on to this artifact is far too great, he needs to find them, somehow.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since he took Blake Willingston into <i>The Container</i>, the Order of the Elders has gone into hiding, and due to that, the deity has had more difficulty in trying to track down these souls. He needs to find a way to find them. But how?
		</p><br>
		<p style="font-size:25px">
			SIX MONTHS LATER
		</p>
		<p>
			Another six months have passed and the deity had found another potential clue, an auction house, however, he needed another person, and due to the rules of the establishment, be on the whitelist. He knew where to find another person, he just needed to figure out how to get on the whitelist, a few ideas came to mind.
		</p><br>
		<p>
			He opened a runed portal over to his dear friend <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku's</span> temple, to see if she was willing to make some time for this little venture with him.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> had formulated a plan, the auction were to sell objects that divine and celestial artifacts, from various religions. To get on the whitelist, he would offer up an divine artifact of his, and to ensure that it didn't fall into mortal hands, have <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> outbid all others, and he'd do the same for her artifact. This would allow them entrance and ensure that they would not have these artifacts fall into mortal hands.
		</p><br>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Oh <span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span>!</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> had called out.<br>
			She took a while to process him appearing, however she had become accustomed to his random visits "<span style="color:#b256e7">Hello, <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span>. Is there something you required? Or have you just come by for to grant me some company?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Yes, I need another person for this venture of mine.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> had responded.<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">As you can see I am so very busy with my work</span>" she said in a sarcastic tone as she was literally drinking tea and reading a mortal book she had found on axolotls "<span style="color:#b256e7">Although, if you need my help so badly, who am I to say no?</span>" she smiled warmly.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Well, it's to ensure divine relics don't fall into mortal hands,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> replied, continuing, "<span style="color:#323334">you see, a relevant map to find the Order of the Elders lies inside an auction, and in order to gain entrance, a relic must be put forth to be bid on.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Oh? Now what do you intend on bidding?</span>"<br>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> pulls out his sword, "<span style="color:#323334">This.</span>"<br>
			She remained silent, alternating her gaze between <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> and his sword. "<span style="color:#b256e7">I mean no offense, but. Are you completely sure?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">I understand your confusion, but I do have a plan,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> stated, continuing, "<span style="color:#323334">and that's where you come in, you see I can't bid on this due to me putting it up there, however <i>you</i> can. The only problem is, is that you also need to put something up for bid to which I will then bid on.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">And in your so carefully crafted plan, have you thought of what I'd be bidding?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">I'd thought I'd leave that to you, as you'd know your equipment better than I do.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Equipment? Am I to assume I can't simply just offer up a Sigil?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Afraid not, has to be something that can't be faked easily.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">...I'm afraid I can't simply offer up my weapon as it was crafted by Terra himself... However... I swear to Gods, you're a dead man if something happens to my Ch'uwa yaku.</span>" <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> said unhooking the crystal like tablet from her arm and hold it toward <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span>.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">You'll need to present it yourself.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> said as he pushed her hand away.<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Very well,</span>" she placed it back on it's original place and transformed into mist. From said mist she appeared in a more human form "<span style="color:#b256e7">And so where is this auction?</span>"<br>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> makes an illusion of a map of the country and points to a location, "<span style="color:#323334">Here, and it's in three weeks, in that time, do you think you could talk to the deity of money since you likely know him a lot more than I do, if he isn't willing to grant the money I have a few ideas.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Sweety do you have any idea how many offering death gets?? Mortals will do anything to avoid their undeniable ending. But yes, I can talk to them if it grants you peace of mind.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">That works too.</span>"<br>
		</p><br>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> leaves to travel around Earth in the meantime, looking for any stragglers of the <i>Order of the Elders</i>. He needs to find someone, anyone who can tell him where the artifact is. He <i>needs</i> to find it.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> spent the next 10 days searching, finding nothing, no one.<br>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> returned to his temple, he went to the room he had made to put everything together; one wall lined with a map; the wall to the left of the map filled with names from the <i>Order of the Elders</i>; the wall to the right filled with drafts of plans for the auction; and the final wall, opposite the map, contained the door and tables lining the wall. Oracate walked over to the map to chart down where he's looked so far, and found a note nailed to a part of the map far away from the main area he was looking, reading "<span style="font-family: Sofia">Oracate, I know what you're looking for, I have information on where to find it, if you can get me a Pukutay talisman. You can find at the location this note is pinned to, I will be there 4 days from now. Bring the talisman, come alone or this deal is off.</span>" signed <span style="font-family: Sofia">The Watcher</span>.  Questions came to Oracate's mind, who was The Watcher? What do they know, and how the hell would he convince <span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span> to just give him a talisman? Nevertheless, he opened a portal to <span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span>.<br>
		</p><br>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Hello my dear.</span>" <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> acknowledged, waiting for <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> to explain.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Ah, love,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> responded, "<span style="color:#323334">Curious, would you have a spare Pukutay talisman?</span>" he continued, handing Nunayaku the note.<br>
			She looks at the note, then at him, looks at the note and looks at him "<span style="color:#b256e7">Why would they need a Pukutay talisman?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Doesn't say, I intend to find out when I arrive there, however as it stands, I do not know.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> explains.<br>
			She summoned a talisman and held it close to her chest "<span style="color:#b256e7">I know you're not foolish enough to trust them. However, I do believe it is not beyond me to remind you to be careful, my love.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">How very fortunate that you are so lenient with me.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> said, graciously.<br>
			"<span style="color:#CEFFCA"><span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span>, I felt-</span>" the <span style="color:#CEFFCA">deity's</span> speech immediately cuts off when she realizes there's another entity standing in the room. The skull for a head flickers, the mask slipping out of surprise before solidifying again. Her eye sockets fill with bright circular lights, morphing the blank mask into a more startled expression. She steps back,  her gaze pinging back and forth between the two. "<span style="color:#CEFFCA">Who-who, what-</span>"<br>
			<span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku'd</span> grabbed at <span style="color:#CEFFCA">Wyrid's</span> hands "<span style="color:#b256e7"><span style="color:#CEFFCA">Wyrid</span>, dear! I'm so glad to see you. How come you're here?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#CEFFCA">I-I felt the mental twinge from the talisman summoning,</span>" She glanced back at him again, obviously spooked despite the lack of a human expression. She lifted her hands from <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku's</span> to gesture at the unfamiliar <span style="color:#323334">deity</span>. "<span style="color:#CEFFCA">Who's-who's that?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">He's an old friend of mine. <span style="color:#CEFFCA">Wyrid</span>, this is <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span>.</span>" <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> turned to <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span>, continuing, "<span style="color:#b256e7">My love, this is one of my apprentices, her name is <a href="C:\Users\skar5\OneDrive\Desktop\Aceonliho Lore\Aceonliho Deity Site\Deities\Mac.html" style="color:#CEFFCA">Wyrid</a>, she's a very talented young girl!</span>" she used her free hand to signal towards him, her face irradiating happiness, finally having them meet.<br>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> walks over to <span style="color:#CEFFCA">Wyrid</span>, and holds out his hand "<span style="color:#323334">Pleasure to meet you, <span style="color:#CEFFCA">Wyrid</span> is it?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#CEFFCA">Um, yes. Yes.</span>" Her wings twitch out of nervousness, despite all attempts to look unbothered. <span style="color:#CEFFCA">Wyrid</span> pulls down her hood, and her skull fades away to reveal her painted face. She's not willing to be so open, but out of respect for a <span style="color:#323334">Ve</span><span style="color:#77309F">ne</span><span style="color:#b256e7">ra</span><span style="color:#F30066">bl</span><span style="color:#c40000">e</span> she figured she should. Slowly <span style="color:#CEFFCA">Wyrid</span> holds out her hand. She doesn't meet his eyes.<br>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> shakes her hand.<br>
			It was noticeable that <span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span> could sense her discomfort, she had known <span style="color:#CEFFCA">Wyrid</span> for a long time now. "<span style="color:#b256e7"><span style="color:#CEFFCA">Wyrid</span>, dear! You never did tell me how come you're here.</span>" she asked again, trying to shift <span style="color:#CEFFCA">Wyrid's</span> focus off of <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span>.<br>
			She's still not looking at him. "<span style="color:#CEFFCA">A talisman summoning usually means I'm needed. I zipped here so you wouldn't have to ask for me.</span>" Her hands start to fidget.<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Oh! You needn't worry about that. <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> asked me for a talisman, so I was just giving it to him. No need for concern. See?</span>" She said, showing <span style="color:#CEFFCA">Wyrid</span> the Pukutay talisman.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Right, <span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span>, Do remember it is in eleven days.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> reminded <span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span> of the auction.<br>
			<span style="color:#CEFFCA">Wyrid</span> frowns. "<span style="color:#CEFFCA">Eleven days?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">I'd not worry about that, as you are far from ready for it.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> answers.<br>
			"<span style="color:#CEFFCA">Oh.</span>" <span style="color:#CEFFCA">Wyrid's</span> frown deepens as she glances back at <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span>. "<span style="color:#CEFFCA">Okay.</span>"<br>
			<span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span> chuckled at his comment "<span style="color:#b256e7">Come now, don't think I'd forget, I know I'm old, but I'm not <i>that</i> old. Besides <span style="color:#CEFFCA">Wyrid</span> is a well trust apprentice of mine, she'd be a great asset to your mission. I can fully attest to that.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">May I remind you exactly <i>what</i> it is that I am trying to get have returned to me.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> stated with concern.<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Yes, and it is because I remember that I give you this proposition. Let her help of needed.</span>" she looked back at <span style="color:#CEFFCA">Wyrid</span> "<span style="color:#b256e7">Of course only if you're comfortable with it, <span style="color:#CEFFCA">Wyrid</span> darling.</span>"<br>
			Curious, <span style="color:#CEFFCA">Wyrid</span> perks up. "<span style="color:#CEFFCA">If you need to get something, I'm fast. I'm really fast.</span>" her eyes widen and she puts her head back down, fearing she spoke out of turn.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">I understand that, but I'd rather not risk any more lives than necessary,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> continued, "<span style="color:#323334">I doubt the need to remind you of what it did to <i>me</i>?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">I won't let that happen. It is my job to let that happen, that is why I am tagging along. I just truly believe she'd do a great job, and it goes without saying that I will never let anything happen to <span style="color:#CEFFCA">Wyrid</span>. I'd sooner die than let that happen, you know this.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">I know you well enough that I know that you won't relent," <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> said exasperated, "but I trust your judgment, but if she is to come to the auction, she'll need to find something to put up. However I'll leave that up to you two.</span>"<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> leaves them to decide.
		</p><br>
		<p style="font-size:25px">
			FOUR DAYS LATER
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> had flown to the marked location, furling his wings, he entered the building.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Hello?</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> called out.<br>
			"<span style="font-family: Sofia">Go through the left door.</span>" A voice called out over speakers.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> walks through the left door. Entering a near-empty room, with a figure standing alone across the room.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="font-family: Sofia">You have it?</span>" The figure asks.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Yes, before I give it, why do you want it?</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> confirms.<br>
			"<span style="font-family: Sofia">I watch, being able to turn into mist aids that endeavor.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Very well,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> makes a table out of the rocks beneath him and places the talisman on top of it and moves more rock to lock it in place, "<span style="color:#323334">You give the information and it's all yours.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> continues, while stepping back.<br>
			"<span style="font-family: Sofia">You're looking for the Artifact, a remnant of an eldritch being,</span>" The figure explains, "<span style="font-family: Sofia">and you know of the auction, there are two maps, they will not sell to the same bidder. These maps, while they lead to places of your interest independently, together make up a fragment of a much larger map, each fragment is two maps, and there are six fragments.</span>" they continued.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Fragments?</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> inquired.<br>
			"<span style="font-family: Sofia">Yes, you can find four of the five remaining fragments at these locations.</span>" the figure handed him a map, "<span style="font-family: Sofia">the last fragment is hidden in an underground bunker, the location I have not been able to acquire. This is all the information I can offer you.</span>" the figure stated.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Why help me?</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> inquired.<br>
			"<span style="font-family: Sofia">Because of your little entrance at that outpost, my work has been interfered with, and the sooner you get what you are looking for, the sooner I can continue my work. That is all.</span>" The figure explains.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">So you're <span style="font-family: Sofia">The Watcher</span>?</span>"<br>
			"<a href="C:\Users\skar5\OneDrive\Desktop\Aceonliho Lore\Aceonliho Deity Site\Mortals\The Watcher.html" style="font-family: Sofia">Yes</a>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Thank you, the talisman's yours.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> removes the rocks locking the talisman in place.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> leaves to go back to <span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334">I met with The Watcher.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Your serious tone leads me to believe you don't carry good news?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Eh, two things, one; He holds the talisman now, and two; there are two maps at this auction, can't be sold to the same person,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> explained, "<span style="color:#323334">and these two maps make up one fragment when together.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Aaaand you're planning on getting those?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">What do you think? There's six total fragments, each made up of two maps, one is being sold at the auction, and I have the location of four of these, the final one, all he could tell me is that it's in an underground bunker somewhere, they didn't know.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">I think... all the pears in the ocean aren't gonna be able to cover this.</span>" she said mockingly, showing her full support.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Ha ha, right, we'll worry about the other ones after the auction,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> acknowledged her mocking, "<span style="color:#323334">Right now, we need to get the funds divvied up, how much exactly do you have?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Not at exact amount, however you'd  be surprised at the ridiculous amount of invaluable things that are lost at sea. I could  get those for you, clean them up and switch them for actual funds. Oh! And of course it was a joke but, black seawater pearl are in fact very pricey</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">How are humans so careless with their valuables?</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> inquired, "<span style="color:#323334">I've taken some rocks from my vault and sold them to some scientists, turns out mortals are willing to pay hefty amounts for rocks from other planets and whatnot. So that's another ~250 million.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Oh! That is not bad at all</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Yea, might revisit some of those planets and collect some more, I think I still have a few runes near there. Should get us there.</span>"<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Over the next six days, <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> formulates a plan with <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> and <span style="color:#CEFFCA">Wyrid</span>.
		</p><br>
		<p>
			Just before the auction, the trio split the funds to ensure that they have to means to bid on the proper artifacts.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Here, a divine blade wielded by the god of blades himself.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> offered up his sword.<br>
			"You may go through." The greeter had motioned for <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> to go on through, handing him his bidding number.<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">This is a Crystal tablet held by the Deity sovereign of Death.</span>" <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> stated, offering up her Ch'uwa yaku.<br>
			"Go on through." The greeter had motioned for <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> to go on through, handing her her bidding number.<br>
			"<span style="color:#CEFFCA">A collection of talismans, used by Mother Death when reaping souls,</span>" <span style="color:#CEFFCA">Wyrid</span> offered,  holding out the forged talismans that <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> had made for her.<br>
			"Go on ahead." The greeter had motioned for <span style="color:#CEFFCA">Wyrid</span> to go on through, handing her her bidding number.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			The auction had continued as planned, with the three deities having bid on the maps and each other's items, winning each bid.
		</p>
		<p>
			After the auction, <span style="color:#CEFFCA">Wyrid</span> had left.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334"><span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span>, before you go.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> called over <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span>.<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Yes, my love? Is something troubling you?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">No, just curious if you can do me a favour.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">What can I do for you?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">See if you can get these fragments.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> hands <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> a map of where two of the fragments are.<br>
			She smiled and skimmed through the map. She looked up at him and gave him a warm smile "<span style="color:#b256e7">Of course, my dear.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Thank you, love, see you soon.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> replied opening a portal away.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> and <span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span> went to get their respective fragments.

	<h2>Chapter VIII</h2><br>
		<p>
			Two weeks have passed since the auction, and <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> and <span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span> have put together the five fragments, leaving to get the sixth.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Alright, here it is.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> stated as he moved the ground beneath them down to the wall of the bunker.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> had opened the titanium wall inwards, whacking the personnel inside the room. Vending machines, counters, microwaves and a fridge lined one wall, with tables and couches scattered around the floor.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334">I see we broke into the breakroom.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> with <span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span> chuckling.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> and <span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span> make their way towards where the vault is, knocking out all personnel that crosses their path. Once they arrive at the vault, <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> forces it open. The map fragments are sitting atop two pedestals.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334">This feels like a trap, stay on guard, and stay out here.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> notes.<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Don't concern yourself with my safety darling. I'll be alright.</span>"<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> walks towards one of the pedestals with <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> transforming into mist and following him.
		</p>
		<p>
			As <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> lifts one of the pieces of of the fragment, a way of energy blasts and hits <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> sending him crashing into the wall, then falling down.
		</p><br><br>
		<p>
			The ground below him shatters as he falls through in to darkness, losing consciousness as he descends into the void.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> wakes up in another place, another land, he recognizes the place as a location as a planet that he visited eons ago, a planet he named Oxiryan, before the fight with the Primordial, a place far outside the reaches of a mortal. <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> brings his hands up to look at them, feeling something off about them; his black pearl ring—a black sea pearl ring with no engravings on the outside, but with a little inscription inside 'Atillcha Munaq', 'Dearest Friend'—gifted to him by <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span>, located on his left ring finger instead of his right.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Hey Love," a voice calls out behind him, "Are you coming?"<br>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> turns around to see no one other than Nunayaku standing there, her hand extended towards him, inviting him to come along  "<span style="color:#323334">Ye—Yeah.</span>"<br>
			"Good, Let's go!" Yaku grabs <span style="color:#323334">Oracate's</span> hands and runs to go.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">I'm coming, I'm coming.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> said, following closely to her, she ran barefoot like she always did. Yaku had always liked to feel the earth beneath her feet, feeling the potential for life in every step she took. <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> had always been drawn to that, and this time was no exception, they ran for a while, stopping only as they finally got to the cliffside.<br>
			"Here!" Yaku said, while walking up to the edge of the cliff. Her jewels reflecting the moon’s shine.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">It's been so long since I've seen this sight,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> comments on the beauty of the site, the cliff edges arching to form a bridge, with the moon resting perfectly inside the gap of the arch, "<span style="color:#323334">I've forgotten how beautiful this view is.</span>"<br>
			"It truly is beautiful." Yaku smiled warmly at him, suddenly she pulled at his hand, sitting down she asked for him to do the same with a single hand motion. They both sat with their legs hanging over the cliff face, Nunayaku still holding his hand.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> felt at peace, taking in the beautiful sight reminiscing of olden times, he looked at her. Nunayaku now rested her head on his shoulder. That peace soon vanished, something felt off, taking his hand away and getting up, he started to walk away refusing to look back at her.
		</p>
		<p>
			"What's wrong?" Yaku asked, worried, "Do you not like it?" she asked getting up and walking after him.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">No, it's amazing,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> replied, "<span style="color:#323334">but you're different, you're not the <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> I know.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> stated.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			The sky fractures.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes I am, I'm still Nunaya—" She tried to calm him down.<br>
			Cutting of Yaku, "<span style="color:#323334">No, you're not, I don't know who you are, but you aren't <span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span>.</span>"<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Another fracture starts.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Oracate," she said, stopping him by grabbing one of his hands and begging him to look at her "We can stay here, you can stay here, with me." Yaku begged, now holding onto both <span style="color:#323334">Oracate's</span> hands.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">No, I can't, you're not real. This isn't real.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> states, tears starting to form around his eyes, the sky now starting to shatter near the fractures.<br>
			A fire starts at Yaku's hands, as it burns her, leaving only ash in its leaves.<br>
			"Oracate—" Yaku gets cut off.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">I'm sorry Yaku, truly, I am,</span>" tears are now falling, the fire now leaving only her shoulders and head. <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> continues, "<span style="color:#323334">but I cannot stay here, not with you, not like this.</span>"<br>
			"Orca—"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Goodbye, my love.</span>" the fire now having fully consumed Nunayaku, and the now-ash figure collapses, the ash falling to the ground.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> falls to his knees, crying as the world around him shatters.
		</p><br><br>
		<p>
			The world returns, <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> lying on the floor.<br>
			<span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> immediately summons a Alliyachiy  sigil just to make sure he's alright while taking a defensive stance to shield herself and him from anything and everything.<br>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> having awoken, gets up and wraps <span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span> in a hug, tears streaming down his face.<br>
			<span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span>, in her motherly mannerisms, reflects his tears, herself crying as she wraps her arms around him.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">I'm sorry.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> spoke softly, tears  still streaming down his face.<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">I was so worried</span>" She pulled away placing her hand on his cheek, whipping away the tears with her thumb "<span style="color:#b256e7">What happened, darling?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">I-</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> started speaking, cutting himself off, losing the ability to speak.<br>
			She had seen enough troubled souls throughout the years, when she saw the look on his face, she couldn't possibly bring herself to force him to do or say anything he wasn't ready to.<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">It's alright, I'm here.</span>" she softly placed her forehead on his, holding him close until he was ready to let go.<br>
			He stood there in her embrace for what felt like eons before he took a step back.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Let's just grab the maps, and be careful,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> said solemnly, tears now drying up, "<span style="color:#323334">please.</span>" he said that last part almost silently, pleading.<br>
			<span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span> didn't say anything, a small nod was enough for both to follow through with the plan.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			No more traps had triggered as <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> collected both maps. He and <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> had scoured the rest of the bunker for any more clues or maps, finding nothing. <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> had portalled back to his temple, bringing <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> with him.
		</p>
		<p>
			After he put the fragments with the rest, now having the fully formed map. He pulled <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> aside.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334"><span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span>,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> said, solemnly, "<span style="color:#323334">What happened at the temple, I-I saw something when I got hit.</span>"<br>
			She didn't say a single word back, she just looked towards his direction, hoping that he would feel comfortable enough to continue.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">I saw Oxiryan, the beautiful moon arch,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> continued, "<span style="color:#323334">and you were there.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">I love that place, I still remember the wind and the beautiful ponds by the cliffside,</span>" she spoke highly of the place "<span style="color:#b256e7">Did you have a memory of us replay in your mind while you were knocked unconscious?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Not quite, I-</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> cut himself off, "<span style="color:#323334">what I saw, I don't know how to describe it.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> couldn't speak further.<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">It's alright, my love, you know you can always count on me,</span>" she said lifting her hand and signaling to her right hand. On her ring finger, a similar ring to his black sea pearl ring rested  "<span style="color:#b256e7">I'll be here whenever you're ready. Alright?</span>" She felt strongly for him, after all he was her first and best friend, only she held dear and close in her heart. She couldn't bare to see him suffer like this, so she would never push further.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> put all six fragments together, making note of the location on each map as he did so, to make the full map. This map leads to another planet. Trigon, a planet on the other side of the Milky Way, this planet has the necessary components of the biosphere to sustain mortal life. most of the landmass is covered in trees with a few plains and prairies scattered throughout, with the water being safe to drink and use. How these mortals have managed to get to this planet is unknown.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is where their primary facility is. And this is where <span style="color:#323334">Oracate'll</span> strike.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334"><span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span>,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> calls, "<span style="color:#323334">look at this.</span>" He points gestures to the map.<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Is that... in Trigon?</span>" she asked slightly puzzled.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Aye, that it is,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> confirms, "<span style="color:#323334">How these mortals have gotten that far away from Earth, I do not know.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Could it be it happened when they took The Relic? Even so, why Trigon?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Maybe, they got into The Container using its power so it is possible,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> notes, "<span style="color:#323334">And unlike us, mortals need to breathe, and Trigon is the closest planet capable of supporting their life.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">That is true, yes.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Fortunately, I still have my old rune network, I believe I have a rune close to Trigon.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Then it's sent. I'll come with! It's been a while since we've traveled together has it no?</span>" She smiled warmly to him.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Very well, We'll leave soon, a few things I need to do first. Wait here.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> confirmed.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> travels off to to go and grab a couple of items for the journey.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Alright, back,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> opens a portal from the rune on his belt, "<span style="color:#323334">let's go.</span>"
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> and <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> go through the portal and exit onto a cave overlooking a cliff face. The cave exits overlooking a giant lake surrounded by trees, with brilliant waterfalls on each side of the cave opening.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334">I forgot that's where I placed the rune.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> joked.<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Of course you did,</span>" <span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span> said half joking and teasing him "<span style="color:#b256e7">Come on, we've got work to do.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Right, we do have a planet to search...</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> trailed off, "<span style="color:#323334">That's... odd...</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Hm?</span>" She waited for him to explain.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Its prescence. I can sense it,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> noted, "<span style="color:#323334">It's not strong, I can't pinpoint it, but it's somewhere between there, and there.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> pointed in a small range between 360 degrees north, and 45 degrees northwest.<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Why would that be odd? We have an area now, don't we?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">That's why it's odd, the area is larger than I would've expected,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> unfurled his wings, "<span style="color:#323334">Nevertheless, let's go.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> holds out his arms.<br>
			She gave him a little chuckle, using the water surrounding them she formed a pair of wings.<br>
			A small nod followed by a cheerful "<span style="color:#b256e7">Right behind you!</span>"<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> and <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> flew over the trees looking for signs of civilization. They spent around three Earth hours flying around looking for this base. They found a shed by itself in a prairie. Furling his wings, Oracate had opened the door to see what was inside of it finding a hatch to an underground area.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334">In here.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> said quietly, as he made an illusion to make himself invisible to everyone but <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span>.<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">What do you see?</span>" She followed his example, turning herself into mist, as to not be detected.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Hatch to a bunker.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> replied as he silently created a hole in the hatch.<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Can you feel anything on the other side?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">No one, feels empty, keep your guard up.</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> notes.<br>
			<span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span> entered first, making sure the coast was clear before letting <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> in.<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">I don't see anything out of the ordinary, my love.</span>" she turned back into her normal form, summoning her spear as a precaution.<br>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> jumps down after <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> readying his sword and sealing the hole behind him, "<span style="color:#323334">My point, there's <i>no one</i>, which is odd.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">What shall we do now?</span>" She looked around, she had felt slightly uneasy ever since they'd gotten here, but now, now that unease had turned into pure discomfort.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">The prescence I feel is stronger here, so it must be nearby,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> commented, noticing <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku's</span> discomfort, "<span style="color:#323334">Believe me, you're not the only who is uncomfortable, but we need to regain the Artifact.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">I know, my dear. Don't worry about it.</span>" She said transforming into mist once more and covering as much ground as possible in one go.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> searched the rooms that <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> passed, finding no one, nothing, something was off. There should be guards here. It's like this base had been abandoned. Personnel quarters empty with devices unlocked, rooms messy. It was like they left in a hurry. <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> checked the devices here to see if there was any other locations, only finding the coordinates for the bases on Earth, all of which he already knew. Almost everything of any considerable value had been missing, but then why would they leave the Artifact? What happened to cause all this? So many questions raced through <span style="color:#323334">Oracate's</span> mind, piling on to his discomfort. There was no one here other than the two deities, not a soul, nothing.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> felt <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> summon him, with a tone of distress. He raced to her, as he turned the corner into where she was, he saw the Artifact mounted on the wall, the Artifact looked as though it had been moved. <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> looked around, he saw <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> lying on the ground, in a pool of a shiny turquoise bioluminescent plankton, her blood. His heart dropped as he ran towards her, panicked. He looked for the wound, forming flames around his hands as he tried to cauterize the wound, as he tried to stop her bleeding.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334"><span style="color:#b256e7">YAKU</span>!</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> yelled.<br>
			No response.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334"><span style="color:#b256e7">NUNAYAKU</span>!</span>"<br>
			Silence.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">No, <span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span>, no, don't-</span>"  begged, "<span style="color:#323334">Don't die on me!</span>"<br>
			He pulled her limb body onto his lap, brushing her hair out of the way so he could see her face.<br>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> stopped her bleading, praying it wasn't too late.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334"><span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span>, please wake up!</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> pleaded with her, "<span style="color:#323334">Please.</span>"<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			How could he let this happen?

		<p>
			Time slowed for him.
		</p><br><br>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> closed his eyes, "<span style="color:#323334">I know it's been a long time,</span>" he prayed to <span style="color:#77309F">her</span>, "<span style="color:#323334">but I need a favour, please.</span>"
		</p>
		<p>
			Silence, still no response from <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Don't let her die, please.</span>"
		</p>
		<p>
			Still no response.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Please.</span>"
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> started to move, his prayer answered.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Thank you.</span>"
		</p><br><br>
		<p>
			Time resumed.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> pulled <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> into a hug, tears streaming down his face.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span> started to awake.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Hey there,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> spoke softly as he cried, "<span style="color:#323334">How are you feeling?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Surprise,</span>" She giggled softly "<span style="color:#b256e7">looks like they couldn't keep me away for long.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">I'm sorry I brought you with me,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> began, "<span style="color:#323334">you didn't deserve this.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">It's alright my dear.</span>" She held her hand over the wound "<span style="color:#b256e7">Just a little scratch.</span>" She summoned an Alliyachiy sigil under the hand that held the wound.<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Argh- Sorry this might take me while...</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Take your time, please.</span>"<br>
			She wasn't even fully healed, but her thought was immediate as soon as her mind was slightly clear "<span style="color:#b256e7">Are you alright dear?</span>" she asked, concerned something could've happened to <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> as well.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Physically,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> confirmed, holding <span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span> close, "<span style="color:#323334">I heard your prayer and rushed over.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Oh...</span>" she finally rested her head back against him. "<span style="color:#b256e7">That's good... I guess.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">I-</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> held <span style="color:#b256e7">Yaku</span> tighter, "<span style="color:#323334">I lo—</span>"<br>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> got cut off as a toxic gas had been released into the room, <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> pulled the wall behind the Artifact just enough to send the artifact flying towards him—leaving the wall behind—catching it in his grasp. He then unfurled his wings to wrap around <span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span>—cocooning them—preventing the gas from reaching her wound.<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Wallkanka!</span>" She yelled in a weak voice. A talisman appeared, Wallkanka, shield. Suddenly a barrier formed around them to protected them from the gas.<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Shit- Ah that hurt-</span>" she lifted the hand were the wound was to check on it, she was fine, still she didn't want to worry him. After all she couldn't overexert herself, else the wound would open again.<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Are you alright, my love?</span>" she asked to <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span>.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> opened a portal right below them, causing both the deities to fall through, closed the portal behind them, leaving them in his rune room.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Yeah, I-</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> debated on telling her now, but decided to tell her, "<span style="color:#323334">That illusion, back at that bunker with the maps.</span>"<br>
			She finally had the strength to stand on her own "<span style="color:#b256e7">Hm?</span>" She waited for him to continue while she finished making sure the would was healed all the way through.<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">It made me realize something,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> continued, "<span style="color:#323334">and with you almost dying there, it solidified it.</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#b256e7">Is everything alright?</span>"<br>
			"<span style="color:#323334">Yeah,</span>" <span style="color:#323334">Oracate</span> took a deep breath, "<span style="color:#323334"><span style="color:#b256e7">Nunayaku</span>, I love you.</span>"<br>
