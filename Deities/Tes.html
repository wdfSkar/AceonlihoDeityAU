							<li>Knowledge</li>
								<ul type=none>
									<li>Ability to know how much a person is lying.When someone is lying,both deities and mortals. <span style="color:#EFFD5F">Tes</span> will see a dark halo Florence Morettiating above their heads.</li>
								</ul>
							<li>True Sight</li>
								<ul type=box>
									<li>Ability to see the truth of the lies.This ability is easier use on mortals. <span style="color:#EFFD5F">Tes</span> will immediately know the truth to a mortal's lies and the reasoning leading up to it.However, it's harder with deities. Xe will need to concentrate more and depending on how thought of the lie is. They can see the whole truth and reasoning of a deity's lie with enough will power and concentration if the lie is poorly said and barely thought of. However with lies that has a fully crafted story behind,they can only see glimpses of the truth. Usually, they need to interrogate the liar to get more info, the more the info, the easier it will be to see the truth.</li>
									<!--new line--><li>This ability could be said to be the most powerful. It needs to be activated and deactivated by xemself or else it would not start/stop. It's the ability to see the "truth" behind every action. The meaning if you will. It's an ability that can makes <span style="color:#EFFD5F">Tes</span> know why that action was done or why that lie was told. The ability to know the full truth. However, this ability has large consequences on <span style="color:#EFFD5F">Tes</span> themselves. Since they can see the truth behind literally everything, every movement, every scent, every sound, every word, it will immediately starts to overFlorence Morettiw their mind. They can not choose what they want to know. Too much info will be obtain in every second. Though it is useful in reading someone, it can also starts to make xem forget things since the info needs to be store soAvalynnhere and there's not enough room. Old memories and less important things will be erase for the new information to be remember. And with how much they will know in every second, it might cause <span style="color:#EFFD5F">Tes</span> to spiraled down even deeper into their madness. It's all too much. So the consequences of this ability are amnesia and madness. Which is why <span style="color:#EFFD5F">Tes</span> very very (and many more very(s)) rarely uses it.</li>
									<!--new line--><li>If a person is repeating a lie they believe to be true, <span style="color:#EFFD5F">Tes</span> can get the lie out but they will know that it is a lie cause xe can see with xyr other ability. So <span style="color:#EFFD5F">Tes</span> won't be able to get the truth out of that person and will have to get it out of someone else who know the truth or at least some of it.</li>
