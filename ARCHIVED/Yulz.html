											Permits the user information on future events in order of a script, pertains mainly to mortals. God influence on mortal actions shows up as blipped out information or smudges in the script. also allows the user to alter certain 'plot' relevant events (This does not include things that lead to a certain outcome, i.e. it cannot stop the death of a person's paNunayakut to protect them from pain, but it can alter more irrelevant information to the plot, such as a young servant being abused without need. Highly case by case, typically it will fail to be able to alter any part of the plot.)

							<li>Scriptor</li>
								<ul type=none>
									<li>
										<p>
											Permits the user the ability to determine inanimate or highly manipulatable mortals end out come. Works like a programming language of sorts. The user must write, in full, the action of the object before the command can commence. (I.e. to dissolve a wall, <span style="color:#c5b9cd">Yulz</span> must write "Dissolve" on the surface. To gift a mortal a message via this method, the HMM will have to be scripted with the message before being set loose to commence the command. When the command finishes, the person is unable to be influenced for the next year)

											Dependent upon the person's personality, they will experience emotions similar to just before an important moment on stage. Jitters, Excitement, Nausea, or just simple amplification of their emotions for a limited time. This will wear off as they get used to the situation they are in (similar to how after the curtain rises, emotions from preforming on stage will end up dissipating slowly over time) and for an equivalent amount of time the user will experience pure calm.

							<li>Open Stage</li>
								<ul type=none>
									<li>
										<p>
											Will open a replay (life via small mostly transpaNunayakut after images of the event) of events for a specific plot moment, done without any bias or skew towards a perspective, even if events reinacted are dramatized to create a better show. Typically, this will still, regardless, try to make the best story out of a situation as possible.

													This ability is able to be controlled primarily through the fans that <span style="color:#c5b9cd">Yulz</span> will carry, upon which scripts are enscribed onto the wooded pieces of the fan. Reading these will, with great variation depending upon the spirit of the fan, begin the effect. The person who controls the "active" fan gains partial control over this power, lacking scriptor or plot manipulation it only serves as a way to create after images of the plot event. (Technically speaking, all of the fans may be active, it is purely a matter of how close they are to <span style="color:#c5b9cd">Yulz's</span> hands and how long it has been since their inscription was read aloud.
